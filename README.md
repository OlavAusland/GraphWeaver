# GraphWeaver

## TL;DR
GraphWeaver aims to easily give developers the ability to explore data & datasets
with a rapid workflow. GraphWeaver exposes a Python API so anyone with fundamental
programming experience can create visually pleasing graphs and rapidly change them.
The architecture makes it possible to add support for other languages in the future,
Lua is most likely the next language that will be supported.



## Platform Support
GraphWeaver is currently being developed on Arch-Linux, so the main focus
will be Linux support, although I will try my best to make it cross platform
mainly supporting both Windows & Linux, if there is interest I will try my best
to make sure it works on MacOS as well.


## Current Status
The project is solely developed by me, so it might take a while before GraphWeaver
is in a release state, in no way is it ready yet, but for the sake of backups,
source control etc, it is pushed to GitHub.
